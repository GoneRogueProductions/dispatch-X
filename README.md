## dispatchx
### What is this?
#### I thought you'd already done Dispatch!
Yes, but the code was as we called it, self-obfuscating. It did not have proper distinction between backend and frontend. So `dispatchx` is round 2, where we seperate the tech stack, and follow standards (eg. OpenAPI). Just a fun practice at coding, not intended to be a polished project :)
